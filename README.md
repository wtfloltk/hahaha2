# DaedalusX64
 
DaedalusX64 is a Nintendo 64 emulator for PSP, 3DS, Vita, Linux, macOS and Windows
 
## Features:
 
- Fast emulation
- High compatibility
- Support for PSP / 3DS / macOS / Linux / Windows
- Active support and updates

## Things that don't work right now:
- Big Endian (So no builds for PowerPC at the moment sorry).
 
## Usage
 
Installing Daedalus:
Download the latest release for your platform from https://github.com/DaedalusX64/daedalus/releases or if you dare, use the latest builds in the GitHub Action section

Extra Steps:
PSP: Copy the entire DaedalusX64 Folder to your Memory Stick and put into PSP/Game

macOS / Linux:
 Prerequisites: libpng / zlib / minizip / glew / SDL2 (You'll need to do this via a package manager.
 Execute the emulator ./daedalus 'Path to Rom' 
Note - Native Apple Silicon build via GitHub is not available yet however it compiles fine and works (Just a bit slow as expected)
## Building
All Versions require these libraries: zlib, libpng, minizip
 ## Buiilding for PSP
    Fetch the latest PSP Toolchain from https://github.com/pspdev/pspdev and install required libraries
    
    Run    ./build_daedalus.sh PSP and CMake will do the required fun stuff :)

## Building for Windows 

NB: Windows build is broken at the moment 

1) Clone and open the repo in Visual studio 2019

2) Build All

## Building for Posix OS (Linux & macOS)
Posix OSes additionally require glew / SDL2

1) Clone this repo 

2) ./build_daedalus.sh (This will auto detect the OS you are on)
 
 ## CI
 DaedalusX64 now has CI, you can get the latest nightlies from the Actions Tab.
 Warning: these builds are sporatic at times.
